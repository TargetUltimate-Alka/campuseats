# CampusEats Brief

## What

CampusEats is a campus food ordering and delivery system. Students can log in,
manage their profile and delivery addresses, browse campus restaurants and their
menus, add food items to a cart, and place an order. They can pay online and
track the delivery of their food. A rider is assigned to deliver the order.
The system also sends notifications when the order is placed, paid, on the way,

## Summary

CampusEats connects students with campus food services for ordering and
delivery. The system separates its responsibilities into Accounts, Catalogue,
Orders, Payments, Delivery, and Notifications. Each service owns a distinct
part of the data and communicates with other services through defined
operations or contracts rather than directly accessing another service's
internal data.
